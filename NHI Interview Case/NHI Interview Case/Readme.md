## Refactoring

I don't really see where I can refactor any further than I already have at a glance. 

## Optimization

I chose to optimize the solution with a singleton backed repository, using the already established
practice of dependency injection. 

## Organizing the code

When I develop software, I tend to go with a folder hierarcy layout that have stuck with me 
since the introduction of WPF and MVVM. Why I choose this is a good question, I guess it is 
a matter of unconcious habits and personal taste.

## Future development if given more time.

I would attempt to add some sort of proxy service for the basic user objects, but I find that
this is more of a philosophical question whether to implement or not. I therefore chose not to 
as the affected bandwidth usage, paging, and lookup should be small enough to handle this as is.

## Swagger UI

I am more accustomed to using Postman (https://postman.com), but Swagger turned out to fit my
needs just as well.
